The end user submits a support request through the customer portal by entering contact information, selecting a help topic, and describing the issue. A confirmation message is generated and a unique ticket ID is assigned for tracking.

<br>

**Step 2**
<div align="center"><b>Agent Access: IT Support Logs In and Opens the Ticket</b></div>

The IT support agent authenticates into the OS Ticket agent panel and opens the newly created ticket to begin review and triage.

<br>

**Step 3**
<div align="center"><b>Triage: Priority, SLA, and Help Topic Updates</b></div>

![Step 3 Help Topic Update Placeholder](./images/step3-help-topic.png)

The ticket is triaged to determine business impact and urgency. Priority is elevated to Emergency, the SLA is updated to Sev A, and the help topic is updated to Business Critical Outage to ensure the ticket follows the appropriate escalation path.

<br>

**Step 4**
<div align="center"><b>Documentation: Internal Notes and Work Summary</b></div>

Internal notes are added to document verification steps, user impact confirmation, and escalation intent. This ensures continuity and clarity as the ticket moves through the support process.

<br>

**Step 5**
<div align="center"><b>Communication: Agent Response and Next Steps</b></div>

![Step 5 Agent Reply Placeholder](./images/step5-agent-reply.png)

A response is posted to communicate next steps and confirm the issue is being actively worked. Clear communication helps set expectations and keeps the end user informed during the incident.

<br>

**Step 6**
<div align="center"><b>Escalation: Reassign to SysAdmin and Transfer Department</b></div>

![Step 6 Reassign Placeholder](./images/step6-reassign.png)

![Step 6 Transfer Department Placeholder](./images/step6-transfer.png)

The ticket is reassigned to a SysAdmin team member and transferred to the appropriate department for advanced investigation and remediation. Ownership and routing changes are logged to maintain accountability.

<br>

**Step 7**
<div align="center"><b>Lifecycle Audit: Ticket Correspondence and Activity History</b></div>

![Step 7 Ticket History Placeholder](./images/step7-history.png)

Throughout the ticket lifecycle, correspondence and actions are documented to provide a clear audit trail. Maintaining updates across the duration of the incident ensures the end user and IT teams share the same understanding of progress, ownership, and resolution details.

<br>

**Step 8**
<div align="center"><b>Resolution: Restore Service, Confirm Fix, and Close Ticket</b></div>

![Step 8 Resolution Note Placeholder](./images/step8-resolution-note.png)

![Step 8 Close Ticket Placeholder](./images/step8-close-ticket.png)

The issue is resolved by restoring service and validating functionality. Resolution details are documented, confirmation is obtained, and the ticket is marked resolved and closed to complete the lifecycle.
