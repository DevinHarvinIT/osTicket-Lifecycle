Step 1 – End User Submits Support Ticket via Customer Portal






The end user submits a support request through the OS Ticket customer portal by entering required contact information, selecting an appropriate help topic, and describing the issue. Upon submission, the system generates a confirmation message and assigns a unique ticket ID for tracking.

Step 2 – IT Support Agent Authenticates and Reviews Ticket Queue




The IT support agent logs into the OS Ticket agent panel and reviews the incoming ticket queue. The reported issue indicates a service outage impacting critical online and mobile banking functionality.

Step 3 – Ticket Triage, Priority Classification, and SLA Adjustment






The ticket is triaged to assess business impact and urgency. Priority is elevated to Emergency, the SLA is updated to Sev A, and the help topic is changed to Business Critical Outage to ensure immediate attention and proper escalation.

Step 4 – Internal Documentation and Next Steps Communication

Internal notes are added to document initial verification steps, user impact confirmation, and escalation intent. Proper internal documentation ensures continuity and clarity as the ticket progresses between teams.

Step 5 – Ticket Assignment and Department Escalation




The ticket is reassigned to a SysAdmin team member for advanced investigation. Ownership transfer and departmental escalation are logged to maintain accountability and structured workflow progression.

Step 6 – Ticket Lifecycle Correspondence and Activity Log

All actions, updates, and communications are recorded within the ticket thread. Maintaining detailed correspondence throughout the lifecycle ensures transparency, prevents miscommunication, and provides a complete audit trail of the incident.

Step 7 – Issue Resolution Validation and Ticket Closure




The SysAdmin identifies the root cause as a backend service restart triggered by a configuration issue. Services are restored, functionality is validated with the end user, and the ticket is formally resolved and closed with documented resolution notes.
